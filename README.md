# Terra Rust

This is a WIP.

no security audit has been performed.

This may steal your money.

This is not investment advice.

Do you own research

## Why?

2 reasons.
1. There was no easy way for me to get the default terra-cli to work on windows
1. I wanted a RUST api to use in other things. The CLI is just cream on top.

# Environment Varibles
**TERRARUST_LCD** sets the LCD URL. eg https://tequila-lcd.terra.dev 

**TERRARUST_CHAIN** set the CHAIN to use eg. tequila-0004

you can also set these in a file called '.env' if you prefer

# Help ?
$ terra-rust --help


If you think this was useful, feel free to delegate to the [pete's fan club](https://station.terra.money/validator/terravaloper12g4nkvsjjnl0t7fvq3hdcw7y8dc9fq69nyeu9q) validator. It will help defray the costs.
